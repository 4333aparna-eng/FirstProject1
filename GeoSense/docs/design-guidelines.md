# Design Guidelines for GeoSense

## Overview
GeoSense is designed to provide a seamless user experience while delivering powerful urban mobility analytics. The following guidelines outline the design principles, UI components, and best practices to ensure consistency and usability across the application.

## Typography
- **Headings**: Use a cursive font for all headings to create a stylish and modern look. Suggested font: *Dancing Script* or *Pacifico*.
- **Body Text**: Use a clean and simple sans-serif font for body text to enhance readability. Suggested font: *Roboto* or *Open Sans*.

## Color Palette
- **Primary Color**: #4A90E2 (Sky Blue)
- **Secondary Color**: #50E3C2 (Turquoise)
- **Accent Color**: #F5A623 (Orange)
- **Background Color**: #FFFFFF (White)
- **Text Color**: #333333 (Dark Gray)

## Layout
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Grid System**: Utilize a grid system to maintain alignment and spacing between components. A 12-column grid is recommended for flexibility.

## Components
- **Buttons**: Use rounded corners with a slight shadow for buttons. Ensure they have clear labels and hover effects to indicate interactivity.
- **Forms**: Design forms with clear labels and sufficient spacing between fields. Use placeholder text to guide users on expected input.
- **Cards**: Use card components to display information such as routes and points of interest. Ensure cards have a consistent height and width for uniformity.

## Icons and Imagery
- **Icons**: Use meaningful icons that represent actions or categories without relying on emojis. Ensure icons are consistent in style and size.
- **Images**: Use high-quality images for visual appeal. Consider using AI-generated images where applicable to enhance the user experience.

## Accessibility
- **Contrast Ratios**: Ensure that text and background colors have sufficient contrast ratios to meet accessibility standards (WCAG AA).
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
- **Alt Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for all images to assist users with screen readers.

## API Integration
- Ensure that all API calls are handled gracefully, with appropriate loading indicators and error messages to inform users of the application state.

## Testing
- Conduct usability testing with real users to gather feedback on the design and functionality of the application. Iterate based on user input to improve the overall experience.

## Conclusion
By adhering to these design guidelines, the GeoSense project will maintain a cohesive and user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience while providing valuable insights into urban mobility.
